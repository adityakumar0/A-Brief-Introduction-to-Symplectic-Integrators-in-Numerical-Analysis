# A-Brief-Introduction-to-Symplectic-Integrators-in-Numerical-Analysis
A project that compares the symplectic numerical differential equation solver against other numerical differential equation solvers via simulation of simple harmonic oscillator
The report comes along with all the LaTeX compilation files just-in-case. The report is accompanied by code implementing the numerical methods in MATLAB.
